## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _In GitBash, clone down the repository from https://github.com/Razieleron/super-galactic-age-calculator using 'git clone https://github.com/Razieleron/super-galactic-age-calculator'_
* _Go to https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ and apply for a free API key using your email address_
* _Once the project is cloned to your hard drive, create a file in the 'Currency-Exchange' folder called .env, and enter API_KEY=(your api key you got from exchangerate-api.com without these brackets) and save the file_
* _Once the .env file is contains your api key and the project is cloned to your hard drive, run 'npm install' to install dependencies found in the package.json file. This will enable you to bundle the javascript and view the bundled webpage._
* _Once you have the dependencies installed, you can bundle the javascript by using 'npm run build'_
* _Once you have used 'npm run build', you can then go into the /dist folder and open index.html which will have successfully incorporated all of the child JavaScript files, and your API key._
